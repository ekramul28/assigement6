    <h3>Discuss the scope of var, let, and const</h3>

    <h4>Ans:</h4>
    <p>var, let and const are all used to declare variables in JavaScript. They differ in their scope and
        hoisting1:
        var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped.
        let and const are block scoped.
        var variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope.
        let variables can be updated but not re-declared.
        const variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
        When declared outside a block, variables declared with var, let and const all have global scope2.</p>
    <h3>Tell us the use cases of null and undefined</h3>

    <h4>Ans:</h4>
    <p>In JavaScript, null is an assignment value that represents no value or no object. It is often used to represent a
        deliberate non-value or empty value. On the other hand, undefined means a variable has been declared but has not
        yet been assigned a value. It is also used to represent a non-existent value or an invalid reference.</p>
    <h3>What do you mean by REST API?</h3>

    <h4>Ans:</h4>
    <P>REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for building web
        services.RESTful web services are built to work best on the Web.REST uses a resource identifier to identify the
        particular
        resource involved in an interaction between components. RESTful web services are stateless. That means that each
        request contains all the necessary information to complete the request. </P>
